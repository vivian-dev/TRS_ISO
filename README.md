# Traceable Ring Signatures

## Logarithmic post-quantum traceable ring signatures from isogenies

Make test programs for the (linkable/unlinkable) ring signatures instantiated with the isogeny or lattice group actions with: 

    make test_rs_iso
    make test_lrs_iso
    make test_rs_lat
    make test_lrs_lat`


Make test programs for the traceable ring signatures instantiated with the isogeny  group actions with: 

    make test_trs_iso

To tweak parameters modify the `parameters.h` file
